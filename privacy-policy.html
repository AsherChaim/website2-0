                            <p>
                            <div>In general, we will keep all personal information collected through the Site for – at a minimum – the length of time required by law. However, we will remove any personal information that could be used to identify you when you close your account, when you ask, or as otherwise required by law. <br><br>
                            We keep backup files as a protection against natural disasters, equipment failures, or other disruptions. Backup files protect you and us because they lower the risk of losing valuable information. Removing a record from our main files does not remove that record from any backup systems. It may take some time before all information in a backup record is completely erased. In the meantime, as long as backup records exist, they receive the same privacy and security protections as our other records. <br><br>
                            If we give you a paper copy of an electronic record, the paper copy will be the controlling copy. Otherwise, you agree that the electronic record in our system will be the controlling copy.
